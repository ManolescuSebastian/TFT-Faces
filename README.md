# TFT-Faces
Display faces/eyes on the TFT LCD devices.

This is a small arduino sample project, that creates a few faces or eyes only from some simple geometric shapes.

 Below you can see some of the faces that are available in the **TFTFaces.ino** file

For testing I used 1.8" TFT LCD and arduino Nano, but it should keep the ratio for any LCD component.
