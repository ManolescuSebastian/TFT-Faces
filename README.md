# TFT-Faces
Display faces/eyes on the TFT LCD devices.

This is a small arduino sample project, that creates a few faces or eyes only from some simple geometric shapes.

Yeah googly eyes are fun on projects, but this adds a new level to it :)

For testing I used 1.8" TFT LCD, but it should keep the ration for any LCD component.
